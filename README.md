# Cloudy Planet

![Cloudy Planet, frame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KessonDalef/cloudy_planet/master/preview/preview.gif)

A GLSL experiment involving 3D Fractional Brownian Motion and Domain Warping to simulate a planet similar to Earth.

It was inspired by two articles by Inigo Quilez, which can be found [here](https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/warp/warp.htm) and [here](https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/fbm/fbm.htm) while reading [The Book Of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/13/)

## Library used

The main library I used is [three.js](https://threejs.org/), alongside with [React.js](reactjs.org) to setup the project and a massive dose of GLSL.

## Test

Tested on an AMD GPU.

Different machines can get different results.
