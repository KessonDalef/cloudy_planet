# Cloudy Planet

![Cloudy Planet, frame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KessonDalef/cloudy_planet/master/preview/preview.gif)

An experiment involving 3D Fractional Brownian Motion and Domain Warping to simulate a planet similar to Earth.

It was inspired by two articles by Inigo Quilez, which can be found [here]https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/warp/warp.htm and [here]https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/fbm/fbm.htm while reading The Book Of Shaders ( [here]https://thebookofshaders.com/13/ )

## Library used

The main library I used is [three.js](https://threejs.org/) and a massive dose of GLSL and [React.hs](reactjs.org) to setup the project and compile.

## Test

Tested on an AMD GPU.

Different machines can get different results.
